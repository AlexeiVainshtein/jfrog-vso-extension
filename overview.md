## <span style="color:red">Deprecation Notice</span>
This extension has been deprecated and is no longer maintaned.
To continue using Artifactory with VSTS, we recommend using the new JFrog Artifactory Extension.
Get the new extension [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JFrog.jfrog-artifactory-vsts-extension).
To facilitate switching from the old extension to the new one, both extensions can be installed and run concurrently in your VSTS environment.
